**name**: Jordan Pratt  
**office**: my chilly basement  
**email**: jpratt@mtroyal.ca

### Getting Help

I work full-time in the department as an instructional assistant (IA) supporting a bunch of courses, so I have expansive office hours! Take advantage of this, ok?

If you have a question involving your code, we'll use the IA Help System to do so:

1. Look up the IA (that's Steve Kalmar and me) availability for the day: [bit.ly/comp-help-availability](https://bit.ly/comp-help-availability)
2. When both **you and the IA you want to talk to** are available, fill out this form: [bit.ly/comp-help-form](https://bit.ly/comp-help-form)
3. Go to [bit.ly/comp-help-queue](https://bit.ly/comp-help-queue) to wait in line
4. When your entry gets a Meet link, go to that link - it's talkin' time!

> _Please don't send pics of your code in an email to ask a question - it drives me bonkers._

Other questions not involving code can be tossed my way via email. If emails arrive after office hours, I may or may not respond...depends on how life is going at that moment!

## Course Assessment Dates & Deadlines

For your viewing pleasure, [here are all the dates and deadlines](assessment-dates-deadlines.md) for your tests, assignments, and drills.

> _You can see that January and March are going to be pretty darn busy...but April is looking pretty sweet. That's by design, 'cause I figured other courses might be dumping on you by that point...plus I reckon we're all going to be pretty burned out at the end of the semester._

# Course Description

Here's what the [Academic Calendar](http://catalog.mtroyal.ca/content.php?catoid=5&navoid=164) says about this course. (I've corrected some grammatical errors in the Calendar, which is kinda embarrassing):
> Data structures important to computing such as basic linear structures, trees, heaps and hash tables will be studied. Additionally, searching and sorting methods will be covered. The representation, uses and algorithms for manipulating these data structures will be examined. The emphasis is on using these structures to solve problems.  
>  
> **Credits**: 3  
> **Lecture Hours**: 3  
> **Tutorial Hours**: 1  

# Assessment

|Assessment|Weight|
|:---|:---|
|Drills|20%|
|Assignments|18% (3 x 6%)|
|Topic Tests|42% (3 x 14%)|
|Final Exam|20%|

You can find all the dates and deadlines for these assessments [here](assessment-dates-deadlines.md).

### Drills

Drills are **short - typically 15 minutes to 60 minutes - coding tasks** designed to give you **hands-on practice** producing Java code that encorporates the topics covered in lecture. 

Each drill will be a **pass/fail** effort: if the submitted code passes its suite of automated tests, then it has passed; otherwise, you will need to address any issues until it **does** pass the tests!

> _Over the course of the semester, I will be taking samples of submitted drill code that illustrates some useful point and going over this code with the class. (Any aspects of the code that could be linked back to a given student will be removed.)_

I expect folks to complete a number of drills - typically about 3 hours worth - each week. The drills assigned will usually be due by the end of **your** tutorial section; on weeks where a coding topic test is due, this deadline will be moved to 23:59 on the Wednesday **immediately prior** the test. 

There are 10 due dates (called _checkpoints_) for drills over the course of the semester + 1 special drill due at the start of the semester on Jan 14. Each checkpoint is worth 2% of your final grade. You will get:

- **2%** if **all drills** in that checkpoint are passing. 
- **1%** if **all drills but 1** in that checkpoint are passing. 
- **0%** in any other case.

> _Drills build skills that are vital for success in the assignments, topic tests...and final exam. Because they are so important, I've put the pressure on you to keep up a certain pace._

Drills will be **submitted to GitHub**. You may resubmit solutions as many times as you wish, up to the checkpoint deadline. Details on the submission process will be provided - and practiced - in the early days of the course.

You are encouraged to work on drills by yourelf, but you may work with your classmates if you wish.

> _Be careful when working with others on drills; I've seen too many students deceive themselves into thinking they know the material when in fact they don't. By the time they've realized this, it's far too late to recover...._

### Assignments

Assignments are, like drills, coding tasks meant to give you experience putting the topics learned in lecture to practical use. Unlike drills, assignments are longer and more complex. 

Like drills, assignments will have a series of automated tests that your solution must pass to receive full marks. Unlike drills, assignments are not pass/fail efforts and partial marks can be awarded. Another difference from drills is that I will be personally going through your solution to provide additional marks and personalized feedback.

Assignments will be submitted to GitHub using the same process as for drills.

You can work on assignments either **individually or in pairs**. (If you work in pairs, you'll need to submit a brief statement of contribution along with your solution. Details will be provided with the instructions of each assignment.)

### Topic Tests

Topic tests are **timed tests** that come in **two** flavours: **written** (80 minutes) and **coding** (50 minutes). 

Written tests will be "written" solely on Blackboard and will consist of short-answer questions. Coding tests are simply timed drills; in fact, the questions you will be asked on coding tests will be **very** similar to drills you have done in the weeks leading up to the test - assuming you have been following the suggested drill checkpoints. I will also provide you with a "practice coding test" for each coding test that will be very similar to the real deal.

Written topic tests will be submitted through Blackboard; coding topic tests will be submitted **exactly** like drills and assignments.

Topic tests **must** be completed **entirely on your own**; no outside assistance from a human being is allowed (though you can ask **me** questions during the test). However, topic tests are **open**, meaning you are free to use your notes, texts, and static internet resources - anything you want that doesn't involve communication with another human being.

> _As you are veteran students by this point, you likely realize that open tests are a bit of a trap: if you are so unfamiliar with the test material that you're frantically looking stuff up during the test, you're going to be completely unable to finish the test in time!_

You have to write your coding topic test in **your** tutorial section. (But it's ok on NON-testing days to sit in on either section...unless one gets so full that I can't effectively answer questions, in which case we'll have to go with our regularly-scheduled tuts.)

#### Test Contents

- Topic Test A
  - Java review
  - arrays
  - interfaces
  - generics
  - comparators & comparables
  - algorithm analysis
  - references
- Topic Test B
  - linked lists
  - stacks
  - queues
  - hashing
- Topic Test C
  - recursion
  - trees

### Final Exam

The final exam will be a **3-hour exam** composed of **two** parts: a **written** portion (100 minutes)  and a **coding** portion (80 minutes).

These portions will be conducted in the same manner as the written and coding portions of topic tests.

# Learning Outcomes

Take a look [here](learning-outcomes.md) for the tyical outcomes for this course.

You might find [this list of concrete](target-skills.md) skills more practical to refer to. This is a living document that will change over the course of the course.

# Assumptions

[Here](jps-assumptions.md) are some things that I assume are true. They affect how I teach the course, so you might find them useful to know.

# Course Policies

### Attendance

I will **track attendance** via Google Meet...simply because I like data. But there is **no attendance requirement** in this course - I **won't** deduct marks if you don't show up for lectures or tutorials unless a test is happening. So please don't log into Meet, turn off your camera and mic...and then go for a nap. That's goofy.

> *Education research shows - conclusively - that **just showing up and paying attention** is one of the best things you can do to be successful in a course.*

### Late Submissions

#### Technical Issues

A **student’s** technical difficulties will **not** normally be an acceptable excuse for late submissions. Start early, back up your work, and don't tempt fate.

**MRU'S** technical difficulties **may** warrant modifications to due dates/times. This is at the instructor's discretion and modifications will be communicated as soon reasonably possible once the issue has been examined.

#### Drills

Drill submissions won't be accepted for marks after your tutorial on April 1, 2021. Of course, you're free to use the drills as a way of practicing/studying after that date. 

#### Assignments

The first two assignments will be accepted late. For each day or parital day late, the assessment will be penalized 10%.   

> *1 minute late? -10%*  
> *36 hours late? -20%*  
> *10 days or more late? Don't bother submitting - you're getting a 0.*

Assignment 3 submissions won't be accepted after April 9, 2021.

#### Topic Tests

**Topic tests will NOT be accepted late without appropriate and serious reason (like illness or family emergency).** If a problem arises during a live assessment, or you know you cannot write at its scheduled time, contact your instructor as soon as possible (in advance would be helpful) such that alternative arrangements can be explored. Arrangements could include, but are not limited to, allowing for the test to be taken at an alternative time or rolling the weighting of an assessment into later assessments. These accommodations will only be enacted as circumstances allow and at the discretion of the instructor.


### Karma

We'll talk about this.

# Course Topics

The topics covered each week can be found [here](weekly-schedule.md). This schedule will likely change over time, depending on our pace. I'll keep the schedule up-to-date.

# Required Texts & Readings

There is no required textbook for the course, but if you would like to use a textbook as a reference, previous semesters have used Drozdek's _Data Structures and Algorithms in Java_. (The current edition is 4, but earlier editions would be fine.)

Pat Morin's _Open Data Structures (in Java), edition 01.G_, is a free open content textbook available at http://opendatastructures.org/ and you will likely find it useful.

Other online resources will be suggested throughout the course.

# Required Technology

### Hardware

You'll need a computer over which you have administrative control, since you'll be installing some software on it.

The tools we'll be using are cross-platform, so it won't matter whether you're using a Windows, Linux, or Mac machine. The system requirements for these tools are pretty low, so most machines purchased within the last 4 years or so should be perfectly fine. If you have any concerns, it's best to reach out to me and we'll talk.

### Software

#### Browser

Lectures and tutorials will be run synchronously in **Google Meet**, so you'll need an **internet-enabled computer** with a **current web browser**. (Google Chrome is recommended.) If you are unfamiliar with Meet, take a look at [these tutorials](https://sites.google.com/mtroyal.ca/techtuts/google-apps/google-meet) available from MRU.

> _Headsets/microphones and webcams are not mandatory, but recommended. During lectures, it is best to mute your mics and disable the camera. When you ask a question or make a comment, then you may turn on your microphone (and your camera if you wish). Once done, please mute your microphones and disable your camera._

#### OpenJDK 11

You will be writing Java code in this course, so we need a JDK: we'll be using the [**OpenJDK 11 (LTS) from AdoptOpenJDK**](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot) because LTS versions are nice and stable and we don't need anything fancy from the later versions.

#### Eclipse 2020-12 & Plugins

Although you _can_ write code in a simple text editor, it can be painful. We will be using [**Eclipse IDE for Java Developers 2012-12**](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-12/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers) in this course. I'm not an Eclipse fanboy (by any means), but it does what we want, is free and cross-platform, and is what many of you are already familiar with.

You will need to add **pmd-eclipse-plugin**, **eclipse-cs**, and **google-java-format** to your Eclipse installation. Having the **CodeTogether** plugin would be useful, too.

#### Git Client

You'll be submitting drills, assignments, and topic tests to GitHub, which means you need to be able to run Git commands on your computer. You can follow [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to get your computer Git-ready, if it's not already.


# Academic Accommodation for Students Experiencing Disabilities

It is a student's responsibility to request academic accommodation. 

If you are a student experiencing disability you must be registered with Accessibility Services to access academic accommodations.

Please contact the office at 403-440-6868.

More information is available at [Accessibility Services](http://mtroyal.ca/AcademicSupport/ResourcesServices/AccessibilityServices)

If you require Academic Accommodations for a reason other than Disability, please make an appointment with Diversity and Human Rights Services at 403-440-5956.

# Academic Integrity

## MRU Policy

Students and faculty at MRU share an important responsibility to maintain the integrity of the teaching and learning relationship.  This relationship is characterized by honesty, fairness and mutual respect for the aim and principles of the pursuit of education.  Academic misconduct impedes the activities of the university community and is punishable by appropriate disciplinary action.  

Students are expected to be familiar with and abide by MRU’s regulations on Academic Conduct which sets out the kinds of actions that constitute academic misconduct, including plagiarism, copying or allowing one’s own work to be copied, use of unauthorized aids in examinations and tests, submitting work prepared in collaboration with another student when such collaboration has not been authorized, among other academic offences.  The regulations also describe the procedures for dealing with allegations, and the sanctions for any finding of academic misconduct, which can range from a resubmission of work to a failing grade to permanent expulsion from the university.  A lack of familiarity with MRU’s regulations on academic conduct does not constitute a defense against its application.    

Find out more through the resources at [Student Community Standards](https://www.mtroyal.ca/CampusServices/CampusResources/StudentCommunityStandards/).

## COMP2503-specific

I really like what Harvard's(!) CS50X course has to say about [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/syllabus/#academic-honesty).
