# TL;DR - Implementing Equals (and hashCode)

- the default equals just compares memory locations; this ain't usually useful
- to create a "useful" equals, you need to choose which fields are going to be involved
- you can use Eclipse to autogenerate the equals code
  - `right-click > Source > Generate hashCode() and equals()...`
- the hashCode is important, so don't delete it (we'll discuss this later)
- sometimes you need to tweak the autogenerated code (like with alphabetic ordering)
