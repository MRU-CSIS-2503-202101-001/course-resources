# Drill Checkpoints

_**Most drills in a checkpoint are due by the end of *your* tutorial section time on the specified dates; however, on weeks you have a coding topic test, drills will be due by 23:59 on the Saturday immediately following the test.**_
  
_Times shown in brackets are estimates on how long they should take you if you have been engaged in lectures and have done some review on your own._
