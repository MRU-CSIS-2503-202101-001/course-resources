# Drill Checkpoints

_Most drills in a checkpoint are due by the end of *your* tutorial section time on the specified dates; however, on the 3 weeks you have a coding topic test, drills will be due by 23:59 on the Wednesday immediately prior the test. I will aim to make the time to complete all the drills shorter on those weeks._

**UPDATE (Feb 04): All drills in checkpoints are now due at 23:59. The days will remain the same - Thursday in most cases, with the occasional Wednesday as noted above.**
  
_Times shown in brackets are rough estimates (4x as long it takes me to complete them) on how long the drill should take you if you have been engaged in lectures and have done some review on your own._

## Checkpoint 2

DATE DUE: **Jan 27 (W)**

_**Comment from JP:**   
Because finishing these drills will help you on the coding topic test, you are being asked to complete them before the test!_

1. [Comparator Speedrun](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-2503-202101-001/public-instructions/blob/main/drill-comparator-speedrun.md) *[38 minutes]*
2. [Comparator Sorting](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-2503-202101-001/public-instructions/blob/main/drill-comparator-sorting.md) _[50 minutes]_
3. [Generics Grab Bag](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-2503-202101-001/public-instructions/blob/main/drill-generics-grab-bag.md) _[33 minutes]_


Estimated time to complete all drills in checkpoint: **2h01m**

## Checkpoint 3

DATE DUE: **Feb 04 (R)**

#### Code Comments from JP

[Here are some snippets](code_review_samples/2021-02-06.md) I found during a random digging-through of some of your code. I comment on things, if you'd care to listen. Who knows - maybe **your** code is in here? In any case, come on in and maybe learn a thing or two!

## Checkpoint 4 (aka The Breather)

DATE DUE: **Feb 11 (R)**

#### DRILLS

Guess what? No drills this checkpoint.  
(And no checkpoint during Reading Week.)

Use this breather as you see fit.

> _But JP, I suspect some of you may be thinking, isn't each checkpoint worth 2%?_  
> 
> _Yes._  
> 
> _You've auto-completed this checkpoint...and since you're on-time, you've gotten 2%._

## Checkpoint 5

DATE DUE: **Feb 25 (R)**

#### DRILLS

1. [Two-Ended List](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-2503-202101-001/public-instructions/blob/main/drill-two-ended-list.md)  **<--YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST**
2. [Chibi Linked Stack](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-2503-202101-001/public-instructions/blob/main/drill-chibi-linked-stack.md) 
3. [Simple Linked Queue](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-2503-202101-001/public-instructions/blob/main/drill-simple-linked-queue.md)

_After getting the Two-Ended List drill done, you can do the other two drills in any order...I'd say they're both about the same level of difficulty. And that level is **easy**._

Estimated time to complete all drills in checkpoint: I'm going to move away from these time estimates...it's just too variable!

#### Code Comments from JP

I nosed around in yer codez! [See what I found!](code_review_samples/2021-03-01.md)

## Checkpoint 6 [aka Choose Your Own Hashventure]

DATE DUE: **Any Day Before Apr 09**

> _Since you have a test coming up and because the drills in this checkpoint are a bit large-ish, you only have to do ONE of the following two drills - and you get to choose your own due date. I'd say they're about the same level of difficulty._
>  
> _If you decide that coding is just SO MUCH FUN (it is) that you want to do both, I won't stop you. I'm not going to give out bonus marks for completing both, but if you **did** complete both, it would probably influence any decisions I made at the end of the year if your were on the border for a higher mark._
>
> _**Finally, keep in mind that even though you only need to code up one of these kinds of hash tables, and the due date is flexible, you still must understand how insertions and collision handling work in each kind, because that'll be on the written Topic Test B.**_


1. [Probealicious Hash Table](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-2503-202101-001/public-instructions/blob/main/drill-probealicious-hash-table.md)

## Checkpoint 7

DATE DUE: **Mar 11 (R)**

#### DRILLS

> _Yup. Just one.   
> It'll be easier to complete if you've got a working linked list class available, either from a drill or from assignment one._
> 
> _**Oh - and this is the last linked-list drill.**_
