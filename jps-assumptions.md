# JP's Assumptions

These are things that I assume are true...and so colour how I teach the course. 

- Having structure to your day is important, so having synchronous lectures and tutorials is useful.
- It's nice to be able to revisit lectures, so recordings of them will be made available.
- Reading code - especially code you haven't written - is a difficult but insanely important skill to have as a developer. So you should read as much code as possible. Drills help with this. So does showing a lot of code in class.
- Reading code and writing code are two very different things. Being able to write code means you're employable, so you've got to practice writing code. So you're going to write a lot of code in this course: in the drills, coding tests, assignments, and final exam.
- Programming - solving problems in code - is very time-consuming. So you can expect to spend a lot of time - at *least* 3 hours a week - programming. This will be in addition to any other additional studying you require for the topics we are covering.
- A good programmer has **grit**: they don't give up easily when faced with a challenge. So I will be challenging you to help you develop grit.
- Challenging someone without offering some kind of support to them is kind of a dick move. So there are many ways that I will be supporting you: I have a schedule that's got a lot of available hours in it, including time on Saturdays. Tutorials are guaranteed times where I can help you with your drill and assignment strugles. And I'm also pretty good at dealing with email questions.
- Working with people on problems can be a great way to build your skills (and happens frequently in the workplace), so I'm flexible with letting people work together on drills and assignments.
- It's equally important that you actually develop skills and not just leech off others, so there are tests you do by yourself under time pressure to demonstrate your skills.
- By the end of the semester, other courses tend to dump a lot of things on you - but it's common for people to be burned out by that time. So the last two weeks of the course are going to be fairly light and there will be nothing due the week where final exams start.
- This is a rapidly changing field, so one of the best skills you can develop is the ability to look things up from existing documentation. So I have the expectation that anyone coming to ask for help with Java won't be asking questions about things clearly answered in the API.
