# JP's Assumptions

These are things that I assume are true...and so colour how I teach the course. 

- Reading code - especially code you haven't written - is a difficult but insanely important skill to have as a developer. So you should read as much code as possible. Drills help with this. So does showing a lot of code in class.
- Reading code and writing code are two very different things. Being able to write code means you're employable, so you've got to practice writing code. So you're going to write a lot of code in the drills, coding tests, assignments, and final exam.
- Working with people on problems can be a great way to build your skills (and happens frequently in the workplace), so I'm flexible with letting people work together on drills and assignments.
- It's equally important that you actually develop skills and not just leech off others, so there are tests you do by yourself under time pressure to demonstrate your skills.
- Having structure to your day is important, so having synchronous lectures and tutorials is useful.
- It's nice to be able to revisit lectures, so recordings of them will be made available.
- It's important for an instructor to be available to answer questions, so I have a schedule that's got a lot of available hours in it, including time on Saturdays. I'm also pretty good at dealing with email questions.
- By the end of the semester, other courses tend to dump a lot of things on you - but it's common for people to be burned out by that time. So the last two weeks of the course are going to be fairly light and there will be nothing due the week where final exams start.
