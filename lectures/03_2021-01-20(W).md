## recap

- to sort/order things, you need to compare them
  - before/after
- if your class implements the Comparable interface, you define a natural order
- to implement Comparable, you need a `compareTo` (neg, zero, pos) method
  - ascending / descending numerics
  - (reverse) alphabetic using String compareToIgnoreCase
  - (reverse) chronological using built-in compareTo
  - multi-field 
- you can sort Lists and arrays of Comparable things using `Collections.sort`
- equals is tricky
  - default is about memory locations
  - "practical" is about fields
  - Eclipse helps out...but you still have to step in sometimes
    - and I expect you to know what the autogen code is doing
    - no...seriously



## the Comparator

- [ ] why bother? freedom, man!

### implementing it

- [ ] just one little method: `int compare(T o1, T o2)`
- [ ] if you're kinda getting comfortable with the compareTo stuff, tie "this" to "o1" and "other" to "o2"

### where to PUT these things?

- [ ] option 1: make a class
- [ ] option 2: put them as conveniences in the class being compared
- [ ] option 3: one-off them in your code when you need 'em

## inline styles

- [ ] old-school: anonymous classes (ugh)
- [ ] new-school: lambda expressions

### using the cool static methods in it

- [ ] wait...this interface has working methods in it?!?!

### rethinking our compareTos

- [ ] let's rewrite one of our compareTos
- [ ] more to follow in a screencase

## Java generics

### remember parameters?

### following convention

- E, T, K, V
- what does PMD say?

### getting a bit fancy with generic methods

### things you can't do with generics
