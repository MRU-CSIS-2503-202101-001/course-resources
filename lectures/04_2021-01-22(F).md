## recap

- things we now know how to do:
  - implement Comparable
  - implement Comparator (additional content out now)
  - implement any interface
  - implement generic classes (additional content out now)
- these are are skills we'll need as we enter next week and onward

## TOPIC: algorithm analysis

> Reminder: you'll find some useful content from last semester on BB under **Previous Semester Stuff**. Look for `03_analysis_of_algorithm`.


### what's the big picture here?

- we will be studying (shortly! promise!) different **data structures** (ways of arranging data) and **algorithms** (ways of working with that data)
  - side note: this kind of course can be crazy in a full CS degree (here's my textbook)...we boil it down to one lecture?!?
- art analogy
- we need a way to COMPARE these data structures and algorithms...to help us CHOOSE the "best" tool to use BASED ON THE SITUATION
- if we want to COMPARE things, we need a MEASUREMENT
  - what choices _could_ we have here?
  - what choice _will_ we focus on?


## SUPER IMPORTANT

None of what follows here - growth functions and Big O - makes any sense unless we're talking about HUGE amounts of data.

Put another way, if you only are dealing with smallish sets of data, then this Big O stuff **isn't useful - and could actually be misleading.**.

### analyzing time

- as the vid mentioned, actually timing things has problems
  - _aside: that's not going to stop me from making the last assignment about doing just that!_
- we need to focus on something else
  - the vid focuses on operations (/, +, ==); we can make it easier and just handwave this even more
    - so println? that's one thing
    - x = 3 + i? that's one thing
    - s = kbd.nextLine()? that's...interesting

### let's do some growth functions

- the video didn't cover this
- I could give you a definition, but if we just do some examples, your brain will get it
- here are a [bunch of examples](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xNfM9G9_eWE8-RNfoMGZbaxntgg_yESb/view?usp=sharing) we'll do together

### let's imagine we've got two algorithms...

- [ ] so for small n, the choice is clear, right?
- [ ] what about large n?
- [ ] how about **really** large n?
