## before we begin

- drills are due tonight at midnight (incl the Comparable Sorting if you didn't finish it last week), but...
- ...remember that you can use Perks to "un-late" drill submissions, so maybe you want to focus on the practice lab test instead? Or just get a good night's sleep?
- Optionals video up (it's not Optional) useful for a week 3 drill and the first assignment
- next week is kind of a reset in a way; we're moving into the main topic (data structures) of the course, so if the first 2 weeks were confusing/challenging, you're still in the game

## TOPIC: concretifying some algorithm analysis stuffs

- growth functions are about building a function that lets you get a rough estimate on how long something will take based on the number of things you throw at it (n)
- you can do some example of plugging n's into growth function as way of estimating time
- Big O is about taking those growth functions and going "OK - what if n got CRAZY big?"
- if you have a Big O, what can it tell you when you double n? multiply by 10,etc
- from next week onward, we'll use expressions like "inserting into a stack is order n^2" or "the bogo sort is O(n^2)", so that's why we covered the stuff

## TOPIC: some odds and ends

- starting project: https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-2503-202101-001/lecture-playground
- hey: did you know that for certain classes, they can sort themselves? Let's go look at 
  - why do you suppose there's a sort(Comparator), but not a sort()?
  - List.of is unsortable
- reminder where to find info on coding/written test info
- lambda blocks vs expressions
