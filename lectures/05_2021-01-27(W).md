## recap

This whole lecture's kinda like a recap.

---

## TOPIC: concretifying some algorithm analysis stuffs

- growth functions are about building a function that lets you get a rough estimate on how long something will take based on the number of things you throw at it (n)
- Big O is about taking those growth functions and going "OK - what if n got CRAZY big?)
- you can do some example of plugging n's into growth function as way of estimating time
- if you have a Big O, what can it tell you when you double n? multiply by 10,etc

## TOPIC: some odds and ends

- hey: did you know that for certain classes, they can sort themselves?
- go over the lab and lecture processes
- List.of is unsortable
- lambda blocks vs expressions
