## before we begin

- with 1/3 of the course done, I'd like some feedback (for a Perk)
  - a [3-question form](https://forms.gle/MTVfGFLWU2HkwGCu6) (need to be logged into MRU Google)
  - it doesn't collect email addresses, so it's anonymous
    - but...my Perk!
    - send me an email with a screenshot of your completion screen:

## Review

- we built us a fancy linked list
  - insertions and deletions are O(1)
  - traversing...well, that takes time


## The Plan

We'll use our linked list from last time to implement a Stack. Then we'll see what that's bought us.

If we have time, we _might_ dabble a little bit with building a Queue...but since that's the focus of the assignment, _that_ particular pleasure will be largely left to you to experience. 

Right of passage, folks. Right of passage...

## Stack, revisited

- pull up our interface...and start from scratch



  
  
## QUESTIONS?

Ask 'em!
