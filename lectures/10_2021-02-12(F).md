## before we begin

- Brett Miller would like a few words with you...


- JP's availability over Reading Week
  - my schedule will be kept up-to-date
- with 1/3 of the course done, I'd like some feedback (for a Perk)
  - a [3-question form](https://forms.gle/MTVfGFLWU2HkwGCu6) (need to be logged into MRU Google)
  - it doesn't collect email addresses, so it's anonymous
    - but...my Perk, JP!
    - send me an email with a screenshot of your completion screen:

## Review

- we built us a fancy linked list
  - ...but it is buggy. On purpose....yeah...on purpose! (that's a lie)
  - insertions and deletions are O(1)
  - traversing...well, that takes time
    - is this a problem?


## The Plan

1. First off, we'll fix our (well, my...ownership, ownership...) buggy `add()`

1. We'll use our linked list from last time to implement a Stack. Then we'll see what that's bought us.

1. If we have time, we _might_ dabble a little bit with building a Queue...but since that's the focus of the assignment, _that_ particular pleasure will be largely left to you to experience. 

    Right of passage, folks. Right of passage...


## OK, add()...let's party

- what's wrong with it?
  - let's kick it and see if it breaks (it does)

  > _tip_  
  > _keyboard shortcut for debugger: Shift+Alt+D, J_

    - how about an add(0, blah) right outta the gate?
      - the debugger is all well and good, but it'd sure be nice to have a toString for our list...
    - after _that's_ fixed, how about add(1, blah)?


## Stack, revisited

- pull up our interface...and start from scratch


## aftermath

- what's our time complexity looking like here?
- what comparisons can we make between this version and the array-backed version?

## terms used

- [ ] **list-backed Stack/Queue**


## your action items

- [ ] hit an assignment checkpoint or two before end-of-day Saturday (if you wanna grab a Perk or 3) [reminder that JP works 12-2:45 on Saturdays]
- [ ] if you *do* decide to work on catching up on drills - please don't forget to ping me for each late one you wish to un-lateify (so I can credit your Perk account, so to speak)

## coming up

- [ ] after Reading Week, we'll talk about the Map ADT and one data structure that implements them - the hash table
- [ ] the week *after*, we'll do a review and then it's Topic Test B time
