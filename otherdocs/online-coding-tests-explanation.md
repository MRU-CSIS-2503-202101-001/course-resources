# Online Coding Topic Tests

You're likely wondering how these online coding doohickies are going to work.

Allow me to elucidate.


## Tests vs. Drills

It's best to imagine that the coding tests are pretty much the same as drills. Here are the differences:

- you have less time to complete tests as compared to drills (50 minutes as opposed to days and days).
- drills are pass/fail, while you can totally get partial marks for tests. 
- tests are worth 4% of your final grade, while an individual drill is significantly less.
- you can't communicate with another person (except for JP!) about the test during the test - but you can totally use any other resources (online or offline) that you want.

That's about it.


## What do I do on the day of the test?

### 10 or minutes before the test begins

- [ ] open up Eclipse because it usually takes a while and you don't want to be waiting for the beast to awake while the clock is eating into your precious time! 
  - [ ] I'd suggest that you close all your other projects in Eclipse...but you might want to keep them open for reference. If so, be careful to make sure you run the right files when you hit that Run button!
- [ ] log into GitHub
- [ ] have a Windows Explorer / Mac Finder window open at the place you put your 2503 projects
- [ ] have a GitHub terminal open at the place where you put your 2503 projects

### 5 or more minutes before the test begins

- [ ] head over to the 2503 Discord Server
- [ ] compose yourself. Breathing's good.

### just before the test begins

- [ ] JP will make the link to the test available on Blackboard (under `Topic Tests` > `Topic Test A`)
- [ ] you're on your way: from this point onward, you'll need to accept the GitHub Assignment, clone it to your local machine, and import it into Eclipse - just as you do for the drills

### during the test

- [ ] if you run into problems or have a question during the test, head into an empty room on the 2503 Discord Server and JP will head into there to chat with you as soon as he is able
  - [ ] once you are finished receiving help, please leave the room

### completing the test early

- [ ] if you finish early, push to GitHub and Submit like you do for the drills
- [ ] congratulate yourself on getting things done ahead of time

### 50 minutes after the start of the test

- [ ] JP will announce that the test is officially over; you now have 10 minutes to submit your exam. Anything submitted after that point will not be marked unless severe weirdness has occurred.
  - [ ] Note: not knowing how to submit is not severe weirdness.
- [ ] if you're writing with the 12:30 group, it is likely that JP will not be able to assist you with any submission problems as the 1:30 group needs to start on time
- [ ] if you're writing with the 1:30 group, it is likely that JP will not assist you after 2:20, as it wouldn't be fair to give you advantages that the other group didn't get
- [ ] I guess JP is saying he hopes you are comfortable submitting things.


### when will I know my mark?

Unlike the drills, whose marking is largely automated, I need to do a bit of digging around with your code.

I'd _love_ to be done the evening of the test. If things are hopping with other student help, that won't be happening.

Worst-case scenario, you'll have your marks by the end of Friday.
