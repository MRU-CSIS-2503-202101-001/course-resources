# Online Written Topic Tests

So how do the written versions of the topic tests work?


## No Blackboard?!?

Um...yeah. I've been bitten by Blackboard tests. And I get the impression that students aren't huge fans either. (Could be wrong there, impressions are dangerous things.)

So given the relatively small number of students in our class and an apparent tendency for reckless abandon on my part, I thought we'd just use shared folders on Google Drive for the remaining written tests (including the final exam).

## Wait...what?!?

I've given each of you access to a shared folder on my MRU Google Drive. The only people that have access to that folder and its contents is me - and you.

It's like our own little 2-way private drop-box! 


## What do I do on the day of the test?

## about 10 minutes before the test begins

- [ ] JP will start putting tests into the shared folders
- [ ] **DO NOT OPEN THE TEST BEFORE BEING TOLD TO DO SO**
  - [ ] Google Drive totally will show that if you do, and...
  - [ ] ...if you do, I will not mark your exam. (That's a nice way of saying you'll get 0 on the test. 10% of your final mark down the drain. Ouch.)

### 5 or more minutes before the test begins

- [ ] sign into your MRU Google account and pop open Google Drive - confirm that you can see your exam there. **STILL NOT TIME TO OPEN THE TEST, FOLKS**
- [ ] head over to the 2503 Discord Server
- [ ] put yourself into that Good Test Zone

### just before the test begins

- [ ] JP will give everyone the signal to start in the 2503 Discord Server
- [ ] NOW you can open the document and get typing

### during the test

- [ ] if you run into problems or have a question during the test, head into an empty room on the 2503 Discord Server and JP will head into there to chat with you as soon as he is able
  - [ ] once you are finished receiving help, please leave the room

### completing the test early

- [ ] if you finish early, you can leave the 2503 Discord Server and go live your life

### 80 minutes after the start of the test

- [ ] JP will announce that the test is officially over
- [ ] close the test document; if you try and eke out some extra time and JP catches you, I'm not going to be terribly happy. I prefer being happy. 
- [ ] JP will remove the test documents from the folders for marking (so I'm saying you won't have access to your test while I'm marking it...just like in pre-Covid life! Ahhhh...those were the days....)


### when will I know my mark?

Good question - definitely before the end of the weekend. Maybe sooner, if things are flowing.

Your marked tests will be moved back into your folder when they're ready and I'll notify everyone via BB.
