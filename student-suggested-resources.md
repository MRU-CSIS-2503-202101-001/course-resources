## the stuffs

- [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-tutorial) (Website)
  > I'm not 100% sure how to pronounce the name, but holy CRAP do I go here a lot! If you're ever searching on Google for Java stuff and you see content here, GO THERE IMMEDIATELY. Solid, easy-to-understand, useful advice with *good examples*.  
  > Make sure you go to their Java section, because they cover other topics (very well) that aren't applicable to this course. 

- [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) (You Tube Channel)
  > Daniel Shiffman is quirky, skilled, and downright amazing. Coding Train deals with a **lot** of topics, many not directly related to this course, so the site can be pretty overwhelming! Still there's much of value here for us: for example, his videos on arrays in Processing (which is basically Java) and Git are very nice.
