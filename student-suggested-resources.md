  > Daniel Shiffman is quirky, skilled, and downright amazing. Coding Train deals with a **lot** of topics, many not directly related to this course, so the site can be pretty overwhelming! Still there's much of value here for us: for example, his videos on arrays in Processing (which is basically Java) and Git are very nice.
