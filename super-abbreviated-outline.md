# Assessment

|Assessment|Weight|
|:---|:---|
|Drills|20%|
|Assignments|18% (3 x 6%)|
|Topic Tests (Written)|30% (3 x 10%)|
|Topic Tests (Coding)|12% (3 x 4%)|
|Final Exam|20%|

[Here are all the dates and deadlines](assessment-dates-deadlines.md) for your tests, assignments, and drills.

#### Drills

- Due (most) every week at end of **your** tutorial period.
- 10 checkpoints, 2% per checkpoint.
- Likely about 3 hours worth of coding per week. Depends on your studies.
- Must do all to get full marks, missing just one means 1/2 marks.
- Each drill is a pass/fail.
- Working together is OK.

#### Assignments

- 3 altogether, first one due Feb 26, last due Apr 9.
- 6% each.
- Working in pairs OK. (Solo is fine, too.)

#### Topic Tests

- 3 altogether, first one on Jan 28/29, last one on  Mar 25/26.
- Can consider them one test split into two parts (written and coding) completed over two days.
- Written done on BB, each worth 10%.
- Coding done in Eclipse, each worth 4%.
- **Open-book, but must be completed without help from any other human.**

#### Final Exam

- Two parts (written and coding) both completed in same sitting.
- Written done on BB, worth 16%.
- Coding done in Eclipse, worth 4%.
- **Open-book, but must be completed without help from any other human.**

# Course Policies of Particular Interest

#### Lates

Of course, life intrudes, but in general here are the late policies for each assessment type:

  - **Drills**: nope
  - **Assignments**: -10% each day/partial day late (no lates on asg-03)
  - **Topic Tests**: probably not without appropriate reason


#### Academic Honesty

- I think working together with classmates on **drills** is fine, as long as you don't rob yourself (or others) of the benefits they provide.
- You may work alone or with a partner on the **assignments**.
- You must work by yourself on any test (written or coding).

Even though there are many differences between the courses, I find [many of the ideas](ttps://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/syllabus/#academic-honesty) in Harvard's CS50X course worth being my guide.

I'm trusting folks and being, I think, very reasonable here. Those who betray my trust will find life unpleasant for both of us.
