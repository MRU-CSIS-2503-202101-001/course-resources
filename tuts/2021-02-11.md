# Tutorial Notes - 2021.02.11

## "cannot infer type arguments for blah<>" ... is a LIE

- it's actually a constructor issue (take out the `< >` if you don't believe me)
- yet again, your brains need to prevail over a tool
  
## An Idea for Future Tuts

- original plan...kinda not working out as planned
- new plan...tips + code review opportunity? 


## Eclipse tips

Very useful website for Eclipse tips: http://www.eclipseonetips.com/tips-archive/

And, of course, Baeldung comes through again: https://www.baeldung.com/eclipse-debugging

## let's debug a bit

- basic idea: a debugger lets you "pop the hood"
- JP claim: if at each step along the way you have no expectation of what should happen next, stop using the debugger, because you're not ready
  - the debugger's main value is showing how your code's **actual** behaviour differs from the **expected - by you** behaviour

### fundamentals

  - setting a break point
  - running in debug mode
    - for tests, it's useful to right-click
  - the layout
    - variables
      - the value of toString
    - breakpoints
    - expression (we'll come back to this)
  - basic operations:
    - step over
    - step into
    - step return: useful for when you go into the Java library code
      - even better: don't go in there any more - use [step filters!](http://www.eclipseonetips.com/2011/06/29/skip-over-certain-classes-when-using-step-into-in-eclipses-debugger/)
    - resume
    - stop

### some tips

- watch your fields with watchpoints
- use conditional breakpoints
