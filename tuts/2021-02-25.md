# Tutorial Notes - 2021.02.25

## some reminders/suggestions

- get the topic b test prereqs done
- don't worry about drill checkpoint 6 as much as doing the practice test

## puttering with Map static methods

- so you've got a feel for how useful `List.of()` can be
  - btw - use it instead of `new ArrayList` to return an empty list
- let's look at what goodies are available in the `Map` class

### wanna make a new MapEntry?

- you can use `Map.entry` of type `Map.Entry`
- it's got some methods in it

### manna make an immutable Map on the fly?

- `of` has you covered
- what methods are in the resulting objects?
- hey - this might be useful for assignment 2....

## some Eclipse things I found out

- inspecting things (Ctrl+Shift+I) is pretty damn useful
- you can open a GitHub terminal in Eclipse instead of drilling down with a separate window
- does anyone else have any useful Eclipse tips you've picked up?
